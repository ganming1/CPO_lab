#1.Title:lab2 variant5

##2.List of group members:WangYinglun GanMing

##3.Laboratory work number:variant 5 

##4.Description:variant 5: Lambda-calculus 
  
##5.Synopsis:
    Complex test â€“ factorial
    A computational process should be visualized as a sequence of LaTeX formulas 

##6.Contribution summary for each group member (should be checkable by git log and git blame);
 WangYinglun complete the Lambda
 GanMing complete visualize

##7.Explanation of taken design decisions and analysis:
 We use lambda calculus to implement the function about addition,subtraction,multiplication,division,or,and.
And we also complete the function about factorial and make it visualized.
  
##8.Work demonstration (how to use developed software, how to test it), should be repeatable by an instructor by given command-line examples;
WangYinglun write file and test file on VsCode. GanMing write file and test file on  PyCharm.We can see the results directly through these software.
      
      
##9.Conclusion:
 Completed with the help of the teacher and discussion among students.Basically realized the function.
